# 🕒 Course Project: Digital Clock Using Logic ICs & 7-Segment Displays

## 📌 Introduction
This project was developed as part of a **Digital Electronics** course. It focuses on designing a **digital clock circuit** that displays hours, minutes, and seconds using basic **logic ICs** and **7-segment displays**. All schematic and PCB design was completed using **Altium Designer**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and apply the working principles of counter and decoder ICs.
- Design a digital circuit to display real-time clock values using discrete components.
- Gain hands-on experience with schematic capture and PCB layout in Altium Designer.
- Produce a manufacturable and functional hardware design.

## ⚙️ Main Components

- **Counter ICs**: 7490, 4017, etc.
- **7-Segment Decoder ICs**: 7447, CD4511, etc.
- **Clock Signal Generator**: 555 Timer or 1Hz crystal oscillator
- **7-Segment Displays**: Common anode or cathode
- **Push Buttons**: For time adjustment (optional)

## 🧰 Tools & Software

- **Altium Designer**: For schematic and PCB design
- Proteus** (optional): For logic simulation
